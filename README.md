# MyTags

Tiny library for tags input.
I needed something simpler and with less hassle than what I found when looking arround, and made this.

## Requirements

* [jquery](https://jquery.com/) (tested with 3.3.1)
* [Bloodhound](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js)
    * Although the example includes the whole typeahead, it isn't necessary.

The example file also uses [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), although it isn't necessary.
